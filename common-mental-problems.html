Obstructive sleep apnea happens when the muscles in your throat relax and block your airway. Central sleep apnea happens when your brain does not send the right signals to your breathing muscles. Some people have both types of sleep apnea, which is called complex or treatment-emergent sleep apnea.</li><li>Some of the common symptoms of sleep apnea are loud snoring, gasping for air, waking up with a dry mouth or headache, feeling sleepy or tired during the day, having trouble concentrating or remembering, and being irritable or depressed.</li><li>Some of the common causes of sleep apnea are being overweight or obese, having a narrow airway or enlarged tonsils, having a family history of sleep apnea, smoking, drinking alcohol, taking certain medications, having a heart condition, or living at high altitudes.</li><li>Sleep apnea can have serious complications if left untreated, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, liver problems, and increased risk of accidents or death.</li><li>Sleep apnea can be diagnosed by a doctor or a sleep specialist who will ask you about your symptoms and medical history, examine your throat and mouth, and perform a sleep study. A sleep study is a test that measures your breathing, heart rate, oxygen level, brain activity, and body movements while you sleep. You may have to do the sleep study at a clinic or at home with a portable device.</li></ul><br>Sleep apnea can be treated with various methods depending on the type and severity of your condition.

They are usually custom-made by a dentist or an orthodontist.</li><li>Surgery: This is usually a last resort option for people who do not respond well to other treatments. It involves removing or modifying some tissues in your throat or nose that cause obstruction. There are different types of surgery for sleep apnea, such as septoplasty, uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP), or adenoidectomy.</li><li>Lifestyle changes: These are simple steps that can help improve your sleep quality and reduce your symptoms. They include losing weight if you are overweight or obese, quitting smoking if you smoke, avoiding alcohol before bed if you drink, sleeping on your side if you snore, exercising regularly if you are sedentary, and following a regular sleep schedule.</li></ul><br>If you think you may have sleep apnea, you should talk to your doctor or a sleep specialist as soon as possible.

These medications can also help with ADHD symptoms, but they may work differently or take longer to take effect than stimulants.</li><li>Psychotherapy: This is a type of talk therapy that can help the person cope with their ADHD symptoms and improve their quality of life. Psychotherapy can involve different techniques, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which helps the person identify and challenge negative thoughts and beliefs that fuel their ADHD symptoms; exposure therapy, which helps the person face their fears and reduce their avoidance behavior; or eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), which helps the person process traumatic memories and change how they react to them.</li><li>Self-care: This involves taking care of one’s physical and mental well-being by following a healthy lifestyle. Some examples of self-care for ADHD are getting enough sleep, eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, avoiding alcohol and drugs, practicing relaxation techniques, and seeking social support.</li></ul><br>The prevention of ADHD involves reducing the risk factors and enhancing the protective factors that influence one’s mental health. Some possible prevention methods are:<br><ul><li>Managing stress: This involves identifying the sources of stress in one’s life and finding healthy ways to cope with them. Stress can trigger or worsen the symptoms of ADHD, so it is important to avoid unnecessary stressors or change one’s attitude towards them. Seeking professional help if one feels overwhelmed by stress is also advisable.</li><li>Building resilience: This is the ability to bounce back from adversity and cope with challenges. Resilience can protect one from developing ADHD or reduce its severity. One can build resilience by having a positive outlook, setting realistic goals, solving problems effectively, managing one’s emotions, and seeking help when needed.</li><li>Seeking help early: If one notices any signs of ADHD or distress in oneself or others, one should not hesitate to seek professional help. Early intervention can prevent the condition from getting worse and improve one’s recovery.</li></ul></h5>'
