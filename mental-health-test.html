Some of the common treatment options are:<br><ul><li>Psychological support: This involves talking to a trained mental health professional who can help you explore your feelings and thoughts about your gender identity and provide you with emotional support and guidance. They can also help you deal with any challenges or difficulties that you may face because of your gender dysphoria.</li><li>Social transition: This involves changing your outward appearance and expression to match your gender identity. This may include changing your name, pronouns, clothing, hairstyle, voice, or mannerisms. You may also seek legal recognition of your gender identity through official documents such as ID cards or passports.</li><li>Medical transition: This involves taking steps to modify your body to align with your gender identity. This may include hormone therapy, which can change your secondary sex characteristics such as breast size, facial hair, voice, and body shape. It may also include surgery, which can change your primary sex characteristics such as genitals or chest. However, not all people with gender dysphoria want or need medical transition, and some may only want certain aspects of it.</li><li>Peer support: This involves connecting with other people who share similar experiences and feelings as you. They can provide you with a safe and supportive space to express yourself and learn from each other. You may find peer support through online forums, social media groups, or local organizations.</li></ul><br>Gender dysphoria is not a mental illness or a disorder. It is a natural variation of human diversity and a valid expression of one’s identity. If you think you may have gender dysphoria, you are not alone and there is hope. You can start by talking to someone you trust, such as a friend, family member, teacher, counselor, or doctor.</h5>'

const d29 = '<h5>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that develops in some people who have experienced or witnessed a traumatic event, such as a natural disaster, a violent crime, a war, or a serious accident. PTSD can cause intense and disturbing thoughts, feelings, and reactions related to the traumatic event that interfere with daily functioning and well-being.<br><br>Some of the common symptoms of PTSD are:<br><ul><li>Reliving the traumatic event through flashbacks, nightmares, or intrusive memories that cause distress or anxiety.</li><li>Avoiding reminders of the traumatic event, such as people, places, activities, objects, or situations that trigger distressing memories or emotions.</li><li>Having negative changes in thinking and mood, such as feeling hopeless, guilty, angry, detached, or numb; having trouble remembering aspects of the trauma; or losing interest in things that used to be enjoyable.</li><li>Having changes in physical and emotional reactions, such as being easily startled or frightened; being always on guard for danger; having trouble sleeping or concentrating; being irritable or aggressive; or having self-destructive behavior.</li></ul><br>The treatment for PTSD depends on the type and severity of the condition, the individual’s preferences, and the availability of resources. Some possible treatment options are:<br><ul><li>Psychotherapy: This is a type of talk therapy that can help the person cope with their PTSD symptoms and improve their quality of life. Psychotherapy can involve different techniques, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which helps the person identify and challenge negative thoughts and beliefs that fuel their PTSD symptoms; exposure therapy, which helps the person face their fears and reduce their avoidance behavior; or eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), which helps the person process traumatic memories and change how they react to them.</li><li>Medication: This is a type of drug therapy that can help reduce the anxiety and distress caused by PTSD. The most common medications for PTSD are antidepressants, especially those that affect the brain chemical serotonin. Some examples of antidepressants for PTSD are sertraline (Zoloft), paroxetine (Paxil), fluoxetine (Prozac), and venlafaxine (Effexor). However, medication alone is not enough to treat PTSD and should be used along with psychotherapy.</li><li>Self-care: This involves taking care of one’s physical and mental well-being by following a healthy lifestyle. Some examples of self-care for PTSD are getting enough sleep, eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, avoiding alcohol and drugs, practicing relaxation techniques, and seeking social support.</li></ul><br>The prevention of PTSD involves reducing the risk factors and enhancing the protective factors that influence one’s mental health. Some possible prevention methods are:<br><ul><li>Managing stress: This involves identifying the sources of stress in one’s life and finding healthy ways to cope with them. Stress can trigger or worsen the symptoms of PTSD, so it is important to avoid unnecessary stressors or change one’s attitude towards them. Seeking professional help if one feels overwhelmed by stress is also advisable.</li><li>Building resilience: This is the ability to bounce back from adversity and cope with challenges. Resilience can protect one from developing PTSD or reduce its severity. One can build resilience by having a positive outlook, setting realistic goals, solving problems effectively, managing one’s emotions, and seeking help when needed.</li><li>Seeking help early: If one notices any signs of PTSD or distress in oneself or others, one should not hesitate to seek professional help.

const d30 = '<h5>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects a person’s ability to pay attention, control impulses, and be still. ADHD can cause problems in various aspects of life, such as school, work, and relationships. ADHD is usually diagnosed in childhood, but it can also affect adults. ADHD is more common in males than in females.<br><br>Some of the common symptoms of ADHD are:<br><ul><li>Inattention: This means having difficulty focusing, staying organized, following instructions, or completing tasks. A person with inattention may be easily distracted, forgetful, or careless.</li><li>Hyperactivity: This means being overly active, restless, or fidgety. A person with hyperactivity may have trouble sitting still, staying quiet, or relaxing.</li><li>Impulsivity: This means acting without thinking, planning, or considering the consequences. A person with impulsivity may be impatient, interruptive, or reckless.</li></ul><br>The treatment for ADHD depends on the type and severity of the condition, the individual’s preferences, and the availability of resources. Some possible treatment options are:<br><ul><li>Medication: This is a type of drug therapy that can help reduce the symptoms of ADHD by affecting certain chemicals in the brain. The most common medications for ADHD are stimulants, such as methylphenidate (Ritalin) or amphetamine (Adderall). These medications can improve attention, concentration, and impulse control. However, they can also have side effects, such as insomnia, appetite loss, or mood changes. Other types of medications for ADHD include non-stimulants, such as atomoxetine (Strattera) or guanfacine (Intuniv), and antidepressants, such as bupropion (Wellbutrin) or venlafaxine (Effexor). These medications can also help with ADHD symptoms, but they may work differently or take longer to take effect than stimulants.</li><li>Psychotherapy: This is a type of talk therapy that can help the person cope with their ADHD symptoms and improve their quality of life. Psychotherapy can involve different techniques, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which helps the person identify and challenge negative thoughts and beliefs that fuel their ADHD symptoms; exposure therapy, which helps the person face their fears and reduce their avoidance behavior; or eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), which helps the person process traumatic memories and change how they react to them.</li><li>Self-care: This involves taking care of one’s physical and mental well-being by following a healthy lifestyle.
